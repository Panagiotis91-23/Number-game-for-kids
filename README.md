# Number-game-for-kids
This project has been written in C++. It's my first attempt doing that. I know some more ways that will prove this and how could become more saturated. I started to use the if utilities however it wasn't useful for more than one time. This is the reason that I use the while and I tried to use the do-while but I faced a bag to this.
